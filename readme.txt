This is an attempt for me to create a scrolling marquee type of thing for no other reason that to see if I can. I would like to get this project to the point were I can not only pull info into the marquee from a database, which is what I have right now, but also include other sources from say Tweeter, Facebook, Google+... you get the idea. 

I am still really new to web development (about two years at the time of this writing), so from time to time I come up with these ideas and wonder if I can do it. I know this is not a new idea or anything, just sometimes I see stuff on a page and say to myself, "Self! I wonder if you can figure out how to do that? Without looking at their code!!" This is one of those experiments. 

First I created a decent sized text area to display the data. I am still not sure if this is the best method, but we will see. Now that I think about it, I might be better off with just a div. Maybe give the background a gradient gray background with a div with a white background, surrounded by maybe a box-shadow just to add some depth. Yeah, I think that would work better. 

The "Submit a Request" button takes you to the form that allows the user to submit a request. Upon submission, we submit the data to a MySQL database. This is pretty much the point I am at right now.

Well, I applied the styling that I suggested above and added animation with keyframes for animation, as of now.
